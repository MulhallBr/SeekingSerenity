                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <h3>What Happens During a Session?</h3>
                <p>
                    During a Reiki session, the client will lie down on a massage table or sit in a chair, fully clothed. I, as the practitioner, will use light touch (with consnet) or hovering hand positions to transmit healing energy to the client, starting at the head and working down towards the feet. The energy works to dissolve blockages and restore the natural flow of energy in the body, allowing the body's own healing mechanisms to take over.
                </p>

                <h3>What Will I Feel During Reiki?</h3>
                <p>
                    During a Reiki session, each person may have a unique experience. Some people feel a warm or tingling sensation as the energy flows through their body, while others may feel a deep sense of relaxation or calmness. Some people may even fall asleep during the session. It is also common for people to feel emotional releases or sensations in different parts of the body. It is important to remember that everyone's experience is different and that there is no right or wrong way to feel during a Reiki session. The goal is to allow the energy to flow freely and to facilitate healing and relaxation in the body.
                </p>

                <h3>How Many Treatments Do I Need?</h3>
                <p>
                    Reiki is a gentle and gradual approach to healing that is tailored to the individual needs and intuition of the client. The number of treatments required can vary depending on the person's preferences and goals. While some may feel satisfied with just one session, others may opt for more frequent treatments, such as weekly or monthly sessions. To fully experience the cumulative effects of Reiki, it is recommended to receive at least three sessions. Choosing Reiki as a form of self-care can be a powerful act of nurturing for your mind, body, and spirit.

                <h2>What is Reiki?</h2>

                <p>
                    Reiki is a Japanese healing technique that uses universal energy to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This universal healing energy is channeled through the hands of the practitioner, and is directed towards the client's body to help activate the natural healing processes and restore balance. The energy flows through the practitioner's hands, and into the client's body to help remove blockages, release tension, and promote deep relaxation. This gentle technique can help with a variety of physical and emotional conditions, and is a powerful tool for stress reduction, pain relief, and overall well-being.
                </p>
