                    That's where Reiki comes in. As a gentle yet powerful healing modality, Reiki offers a simple and effective way to reduce stress, promote relaxation, and support overall well-being. By tapping into the universal life force energy that flows through all living things, Reiki can help to restore balance and harmony to the body, mind, and spirit. It is a safe and non-invasive approach to healing that can complement other treatments or be used on its own to achieve powerful results.

                <h2>How Does Reiki Work?</h2>

                <p>
                    Reiki is a Japanese healing technique that works to balance the body's energy centers, or chakras, by transmitting healing energy through light touch or hovering hand positions. It promotes physical, emotional, and spiritual healing by dissolving blockages and restoring the natural flow of energy in the body. Reiki can treat chronic pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and promote overall well-being by reducing stress and increasing relaxation.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Reiki works by tapping into the body's natural ability to heal itself, promoting relaxation and balance in the body's energy centers. During a session, the client lies down fully clothed and the practitioner places their hands on or near the client's body in a series of hand positions. The client may feel warmth or tingling sensations and report feeling deeply relaxed and calm afterwards. Reiki is a gentle yet powerful form of healing that can be used to address a wide range of physical, emotional, and spiritual concerns.
